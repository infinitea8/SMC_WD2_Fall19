First of all, there is so much opportunity other than sports, for kids to do today. Kids find inspiration with the latest crop of young multi-talented, multi-millionaire in some case billionaire media influencers like Kylie Jenner, @HudaKattan, @camerondallas, @Zackking. Even academically with teenage App developers, <a href="https://twitter.com/orbuch" data-href="https://twitter.com/orbuch" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ryan Orbuch</a> or Alexandra Jordan, or musically with artists like Cardi B, Ariana Grande and many more.</p><p name="e5bd" id="e5bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Look at that lineup! No wonder why kids are quitting team sports. According to an ESPN study, girls and boys alike stop team sports because:</p><figure name="da97" id="da97" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 1116px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 159.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*foZZ2RTUvvq8KZGdEuQEMw.jpeg" data-width="1214" data-height="1935" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*foZZ2RTUvvq8KZGdEuQEMw.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="1afe" id="1afe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">(see fig)</p><p name="1175" id="1175" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Horses are out the barn now!

Reduce worry of injury for the family and athlete.</p><p name="a2cd" id="a2cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">b.) Increase the fun and camaraderie</p><p name="633e" id="633e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are competing with top young social media influencers that make money, have fun and see the world. Some of them are trainers, yogis, or have been athletes at some point.</p><p name="a50a" id="a50a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What solutions are available?</p><p name="caa6" id="caa6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why not start by addressing some of the reasons kids leave? The National Strength and Conditioning Association has determined that strength and conditioning for the youth athlete can be both safe and effective in improving strength, coordination, and athleticism starting from the age of six (NSCA, 2009). Yoga, too plays a very important part in preparation, mentally, physically and inspirationally! How many Beach Club owners today, integrate Yoga, Strength, and Wellness in your specialized programs? According to that study, the top benefits for incorporating Strength and Conditioning are:</p><p name="c37b" id="c37b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Preparation for the Future-In the past ten years, long-term athletic development (LTAD) and youth physical development (YPD) have been the cornerstone models for the development of young athletes. These two distinct approaches use a holistic view of training, so that age, growth, maturity and training level are all taken into consideration when a program is designed for an individual. Strength and conditioning training has a significant role in ensuring that young athletes become more coordinated, stable and robust as they advance through their athletic careers.</p><p name="557f" id="557f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. Reduced Injury Risk-Despite concerns in the past that strength training is harmful to the youth athlete, it has been revealed that strength and conditioning can make a developing athlete “more resistant to injury” (NSCA, 2008). A higher level of motor control and a better understanding of how their body moves in space, allows an athlete to take more control over their injury prevention. Strategies of how to correctly stabilize the core, distribute bodyweight and resist force are all areas which can lower the risk of injury.</p><p name="32d6" id="32d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3. Increases in Strength-The increases in muscular strength seen in childhood can be greater than the strength increases seen in adolescence (Joyce, 2014) which evidences why the early initiation of a formal strength and conditioning plan is an important step. Individuals who train twice per week, on average, have 33% higher strength gains than their once session per week counterparts. Stronger athletes perform better, are more trainable and have the most long-term success.</p><p name="895f" id="895f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4. Smaller Incidence of burnout or overspecialization-As more sports teams, coaches and parents are pushing for children to specialize in a sport earlier in their careers, it is important to make sure that health and fun are major components of the process. Optimally, specialization should be held off until adolescence so that the athlete has time to develop a large majority of “fundamental movement skills” before “sport specific skills” (Joyce, 2014) are a large portion of the focus. Early adoption of specialization can lead to burnout, overuse injuries and potentially social isolation.</p><p name="9408" id="9408" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5. More enjoyment in movement and physical activity for a lifetime-Strength and conditioning is a way to learn how to positively impact movement quality through mobility and movement training. All movements in our lives have an optimal way to be performed, and the better you are at performing those movements, the better chance you have of continuing those movements.</p><p name="44c5" id="44c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While the top 5 benefits for yoga are:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="4788" id="4788" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Regular yoga practice helps prevent injuries and speeds recovery from strenuous workouts.</li><li name="c84a" id="c84a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It helps with breathing, flexibility, strength, confidence, energy, balance, concentration, endurance and injury prevention.</li><li name="aedd" id="aedd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It helps prepare young athletes in learning how their bodies work. Proper yoga instruction teaches body mechanics and enhances body awareness.</li><li name="59f1" id="59f1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">My favorite is that it teaches players how to harness their breathing and focus on the present. Being able to visualize the next shot in basketball or hit in football can help improve their game.</li><li name="b2f1" id="b2f1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It teaches players how to slow down, regenerate from their strenuous workouts and relax. With the intense pressure to do well in school and sports, most kids don’t take the time to reap the benefits of their hard work.</li></ol><p name="1fd1" id="1fd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">What does this mean today?</p><p name="723f" id="723f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That right now is a perfect chance to introduce and teach activities that are a huge part of what they see on social media every day. It’s a winning formula.</p><p name="f89d" id="f89d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why not reduce the risk of injury, make better players, expose your kids to other quality coaches while easing the minds of the parents. Demonstrate that their wellness is your top priority. I’d sign my kid up for that program!</p><p name="2c41" id="2c41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a Club owner or Coach of a soccer, volleyball, basketball, football even cheerleading team, consider adding Yoga and resistance training to your athletes’ program. The upsides are the gifts that keep on giving long after they leave the sport.</p><p name="35bd" id="35bd" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="3ebf" id="3ebf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sources for my information:</p><p name="6c43" id="6c43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5 Benefits of Strength and Conditioning Training for the Young Athlete</strong></p><p name="a448" id="a448" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dylan Mudlo, MS, CSCS This article originally appeared on <a href="https://www.ironcityelite.com/new-blog/2015/6/25/5-benefits-of-strength-and-conditioning-training-for-the-youth-athlete" data-href="https://www.ironcityelite.com/new-blog/2015/6/25/5-benefits-of-strength-and-conditioning-training-for-the-youth-athlete" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dylan Mudlo’s blog</a>, Iron City Elite on June 25, 2015.</p><p name="e3f2" id="e3f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.activekids.com/parenting-and-family/articles/7-yoga-poses-for-young-athletes" data-href="https://www.activekids.com/parenting-and-family/articles/7-yoga-poses-for-young-athletes" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.activekids.com/parenting-and-family/articles/7-yoga-poses-for-young-athletes</a></p><p name="6e1d" id="6e1d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
